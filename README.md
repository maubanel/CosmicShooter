# Cosmic Shooter

Very basic introduction to the Game Maker Programming Language (GML). This was done in Gamemaker Studio II. You will need to download this from [Yoyo Games](https://www.yoyogames.com/get).

This is an exercise where we introduce younger students to computational thinking, simple geometry and a little bit of physics.  This can be done with students as young as 12 (amd maybe even younger).  It is inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids.  I normally do this by live coding in a theater where students come to the computer one at a time and I have the team help solve the problem as a classroom.

I do a longer version of this demonstration with middle and high school students by a live coding event in our theater. If you are interested in seeing it, I have it on git hub [here](https://github.com/maubanel/cosmic-shooter-extended).

This will run both on the Mac & PC.  Clone or download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/maubanel/CosmicShooter`.

Run the game by double clicking on `CosmicShooter.yyp`. Full walk-through is included in instructions.pdf.
