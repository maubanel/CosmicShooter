# CosmicShooter

Very basic introduction to the Game Maker Programming Language (GML). This was done in Gamemaker Studio II. You will need to download this from [Yoyo Games](https://www.yoyogames.com/get)

This will run both on the Mac & PC.  Clone or download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/maubanel/CosmicShooter`.

Run the game by double clicking on `CosmicShooter.yyp`.
